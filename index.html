        <h2>Keepers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Teams may keep a player for 5 * (number of years they've been on your roster) + last year's auction value</li>
<li>Teams may keep 0, 1, or 2 players</li>
<li>Teams have until exactly 1 hour before the auction to set their keepers.  Failure to do so means you forfeit your keepers.</li>
</ul><h2>Trades</h2>

<ul>
<li>Trade deadline is firm, it's your responsibility to be aware of it (no extensions).</li>
<li>Trades can be vetoed by any 5 teams voting against it</li>
<li>A trade takes 2 days to clear (keep that in mind for Thursday games later in the season!)</li>
</ul><h2>Playoffs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Teams are divided into 6 team conferences</li>
<li>The top 3 teams from each conference make the playoffs</li>
<li>The top teams from each conference are seeds #1 and #2 and get a first round bye

<ul>
<li>This happens even if another team has a better record or would win a tiebreaker with the other team (ie, one division is stacked and the other sucks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the top two, the remaining four teams are seeded based on record and tiebreakers, regardless of division</li>
</ul><h2>Seeding tiebreakers (in order)</h2>

<ul>
<li>overall record</li>
<li>total points for</li>
<li>head to head</li>
<li>ESPN gets to decide after that</li>
</ul><h2>Payout Structure</h2>

<ul>
<li>$50 entry fee

<ul>
<li>1st place:   $550</li>
<li>2nd place:    $50</li>
<li>Everyone else: $0</li>
</ul>

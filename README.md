THE OMICHRONIC 2012 RULEBOOK
==========
_Codifying the rules for our fantasy football league._

Keepers
============
* Teams may keep a player for 5 * (number of years they've been on your roster) + last year's auction value
* Teams may keep 0, 1, or 2 players
* Teams have until exactly 1 hour before the auction to set their keepers.  Failure to do so means you forfeit your keepers.
* A player who was drafted, dropped, and picked up by another team has a "last year auction value" of $0, and thus may be kept for $5.

Trades
============
* Trade deadline is firm, it's your responsibility to be aware of it (no extensions).
* Trades can be vetoed by any 5 teams voting against it
* A trade takes 2 days to clear (keep that in mind for Thursday games later in the season!)

Playoffs
============
* Teams are divided into 6 team conferences
* The top 3 teams from each conference make the playoffs
* The top teams from each conference are seeds #1 and #2 and get a first round bye
  * This happens even if another team has a better record or would win a tiebreaker with the other team (ie, one division is stacked and the other sucks)
* After the top two, the remaining four teams are seeded based on record and tiebreakers, regardless of division

Seeding tiebreakers (in order)
==
  * overall record
  * total points for
  * head to head
  * ESPN gets to decide after that

Payout Structure
==
* 50 entry fee
 * 1st place:   everything else
 * 2nd place:    entry fee back
 * Everyone else: nothing
